Welcome to my corner of the internet. This is where I write about things that interest me: tech, software engineering, problem-solving and the occasional life observation. 

I am an avid reader of blogs, documentation, books and I always admired the people who could write about their thoughts and experiences. As a young teenager I even used to write about tech tutorials on blogspot. 


## Why a Blog?

I wanted a space for longer and more considered writing. A place where I write about things that I find interesting and it may help others too. This blog also acts as a personal knowledge base and archive for me. 

## What to Expect

I write about:

- **Technology** - Software development, general tech tools. 
- **Engineering** - Software engineering, deep dives, and tech insights.
- **Personal** - Personal thoughts, experiences, and observations
- **Thinking** - Problem-solving approaches and mental models
- **Life** - Observations and experiences worth sharing

I might also share book reviews, tutorials, and other interesting topics that catch my attention.

No fixed schedule. Just writing when there's something worth saying.

## Philosophy around building this blog

I wanted to build a static blog using SvelteKit and keep it as minimal as possible for a distraction-free writing and reading experience. I don't want to make it complex or add unnecessary features. A simple markdown based blog with a static site generator, pushed to github and deployed using cloudflare pages.

## Tech Stack


- **SvelteKit** - The framework I used to build this blog.
- **TypeScript** - For type safety and better experience.
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling and responsiveness.
- **mdsvex** - For markdown support.
- **Shiki** - For syntax highlighting.
- **Cloudflare Pages** - For hosting.

Check the [repository](https://github.com/navadeepnaidu7/blog) for more details.

**Code Example**
A simple example to test syntax highlighting:

```java
public static String greet(String name) {
    return "Hello world";
}
```
