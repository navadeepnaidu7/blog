Welcome to my corner of the internet.

This is where I write about things that interest me: technology, problem-solving, and the occasional life observation. I believe in clear thinking and simple expression.


## Why a Blog?

In an age of tweets and short-form content, I wanted a space for longer, more considered writing. A place where I own my words and can think through ideas properly.

## What to Expect

I'll write about:

- **Technology** - Software development, tools, and technical explorations
- **Thinking** - Problem-solving approaches and mental models
- **Life** - Observations and experiences worth sharing

No fixed schedule. Just writing when there's something worth saying.

## Code Example

Here's a simple example to test syntax highlighting:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

Thanks for visiting.
