There's a joke in programming circles that developers would rather spend hours debugging than five minutes reading documentation. Like most good jokes, it's funny because it's true.

I used to be that developer. I'd dive into code, try things, fail, search Stack Overflow, try more things. It was inefficient, but it felt productive. The keyboard was clacking, code was being written.

## The Documentation Advantage

Then I worked with a senior developer who did something strange. When we started using a new library, she spent the first hour just reading. Not skimming, not searching for specific answers, but actually reading the documentation from start to finish.

It seemed like such a waste of time. Until she finished a feature in half the time it took me, with half the bugs.

## What Documentation Teaches You

Good documentation tells you more than just how to use something. It tells you:

- **Why** things work the way they do
- **What tradeoffs** the authors considered
- **Which patterns** are idiomatic
- **What pitfalls** to avoid

This context is invaluable. It's the difference between using a tool and understanding it.

## A Practical Approach

I've developed a simple habit: before using any new library or framework, I spend at least 30 minutes with its documentation. Not searching for specific answers, but reading.

The investment pays off every time.

Some of my favorite documentation:

1. **Stripe's API docs** - Clear, comprehensive, with excellent examples
2. **React's new documentation** - Teaches concepts, not just APIs
3. **PostgreSQL manual** - Incredibly thorough, with deep explanations

## The Meta-Skill

Learning to read documentation well is a meta-skill. It makes you better at learning everything else. And in a field that changes as quickly as software development, that might be the most valuable skill of all.

Start with five minutes a day. You'll be surprised how much you learn.
