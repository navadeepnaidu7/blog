We live in an age of instant everything. Instant messages, instant answers, instant gratification. Speed is the default mode, and slowness feels like failure.

But some of the best work I've done came from thinking slowly. From sitting with a problem, turning it over in my mind, resisting the urge to immediately act.

## The Myth of Productivity

There's a persistent myth that productivity means doing more, faster. Fill every moment. Optimize every process. Eliminate all friction.

This works for certain kinds of work. Assembly lines benefit from speed. Manufacturing benefits from efficiency. But creative work, knowledge work, thinking work, operates differently.

Ideas need time to develop. Connections need space to form. Insights emerge from the unconscious mind, and they can't be rushed.

## The Power of the Pause

I've started building pauses into my work. When I encounter a complex problem, my first instinct now is not to solve it immediately, but to sit with it. To understand it fully before reaching for solutions.

This feels counterintuitive. It feels like procrastination. But it's not. It's giving the problem the time it deserves.

Some techniques I've found helpful:

- **Walking without podcasts.** Just thinking, or not thinking at all.
- **Writing before deciding.** Clarifying thoughts on paper.
- **Sleeping on big decisions.** The unconscious mind keeps working.

## The Competitive Advantage of Patience

In a world where everyone is optimizing for speed, patience becomes a competitive advantage. The person willing to think for a week instead of acting in an hour often produces better work.

Not always. Sometimes speed matters. But less often than we think.

## A Different Relationship with Time

I'm learning to have a different relationship with time. Not as something to be maximized, but as something to be used thoughtfully. Some moments call for speed. Others call for slowness.

The skill is knowing which is which.

And when in doubt, slow down. The world will wait.
