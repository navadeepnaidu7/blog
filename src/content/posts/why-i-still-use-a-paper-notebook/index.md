I have access to every note-taking app ever made. Notion, Obsidian, Apple Notes, Roam Research, I've tried them all. And yet, every morning, I reach for the same thing: a simple paper notebook.

This isn't nostalgia. It's not a rejection of technology. It's a deliberate choice based on years of experimentation.

## The Friction is the Feature

Digital tools optimize for frictionlessness. Sync everywhere. Search everything. Link anything. These are real advantages.

But friction serves a purpose. The resistance of pen on paper slows thought. It forces clarity. You can't easily delete, so you think before writing.

This friction makes paper better for certain kinds of thinking. Specifically, the kind where you're trying to figure something out, not just record something you already know.

## What I Use Paper For

Not everything. I'm not a luddite. My paper notebook has a specific purpose:

- **Morning thinking.** Before the day starts, before I check anything digital.
- **Complex problems.** When I need to work through something difficult.
- **Creative work.** Initial ideas, rough drafts, brainstorming.

Everything else lives digitally. Reference material, task lists, meeting notes, all in their appropriate apps.

## The Ritual Matters

There's also something to be said for ritual. Opening a notebook, uncapping a pen, these physical acts signal to my brain that it's time to think. Digital devices carry too many associations, too many temptations.

The notebook is singular in purpose. It exists only for thinking. That simplicity has power.

## Try It

If you've never kept a paper notebook, try it for a week. Just one designated time per day, pen and paper, no phones nearby. See what emerges.

You might be surprised. I was.

The best tools aren't always the newest. Sometimes, the ones that have worked for centuries work for a reason.
